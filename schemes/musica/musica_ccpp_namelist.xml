<!-- Each namelist variable is defined in an <entry> element.  The
     content of the element is the documentation of how the variable is
     used.  Other aspects of the variable's definition are expressed as
     attributes of the <entry> element.  Note that it is an XML requirement
     that the attribute values are enclosed in quotes.  The attributes are:

     id
          The variable's name.  *** N.B. *** The name must be lower case.
          The module convert all namelist variable names to lower case
          since Fortran is case insensitive.

     type
          An abbreviation of the fortran declaration for the variable.
	  Valid declarations are:

          char*n
	  integer
	  logical
	  real

	  Any of these types may be followed by a comma separated list of
	  integers enclosed in parenthesis to indicate an array.

	  The current namelist validation code only distinquishes between
	  string and non-string types.

     input_pathname
          Only include this attribute to indicate that the variable
          contains the pathname of an input dataset that resides in the
          CESM inputdata directory tree.  Note that the variables
          containing the names of restart files that are used in branch
          runs don't reside in the inputdata tree and should not be given
          this attribute.

	  The recognized values are "abs" to indicate that an absolute
          pathname is required, or "rel:var_name" to indicate that the
          pathname is relative and that the namelist variable "var_name"
          contains the absolute root directory.

     category
          A category assigned for organizing the documentation.

     group
          The namelist group that the variable is declared in.

     valid_values
          This is an optional attribute that is mainly useful for variables
          that have only a small number of allowed values. It is a
          comma-separated list of valid values for the variable.

     desc
          This is a text description of the variable including its
          purpose and use.

     values
          This is a grouping of all the cases where a value can be
          assigned with the namelist generator has been run.

     value
          Each <value> tag specifies a case where a value is assigned
          to this variable when the namelist generator is run. If the
          tag has no attributes, it is a default value. In general,
          the namelist generator attempts to find a value with the
          maximium number of attribute matches (and no non-matches).

     standard_name
          This is the CCPP Standard Name of the variable

     units
          This is the CCPP unit specification of the variable (e.g., m s-1).
                                                                        -->
