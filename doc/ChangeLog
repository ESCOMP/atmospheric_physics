One-line Summary: tropopause_find CCPP-ization
Github PR URL: https://github.com/ESCOMP/atmospheric_physics/pull/112

This PR fixes the following NCAR/atmospheric_physics Github issues:
    - Creates the CCPP interface for the tropopause_find routine

    Several (extensive) changes were made to tropopause_find.F90 for CCPP-compatibility:
    - tropopause_read_file, which provides tropp_p_loc and tropp_days climatological data used as the default fall-back method, has been moved to a utility module in CAM-SIMA to read, regrid, and provide this climatology to the CCPP-ized physics; it also removes lchnk indexing since they're no longer used in CAM-SIMA.
    - tropopause_find used to accept (optional) arguments for returning tropT, tropZ, tropP (tropopause temperature, height, and pressure) which are no longer optional;
    - tropopause_find accepted "primary" and "backup" methods for finding the tropopause. All the methods known to be used in CAM are now calculated at the same time in the tropopause_find_run main driver routine; it calls the underlying logic as appropriate with and populates the appropriate standard name physics fields. Because the same physical quantities for tropopause level, height, pressure, temperature, etc. using different methods are used throughout the CAM physics and simultaneously output in the diagnostics, the same standard names with a suffix are used to differentiate between these quantities computed by different methods.
    - Standard CCPP-ization procedures, metadata, explicit use of fields instead of physics state, only passing active :ncol fields, ...

    CAM interface code that will completely replicate existing behavior, bit-for-bit in current CAM, will be included in current CAM as tropopause.F90.

Registers constituents and sets needed constituent properties from MICM configuration.

Additionally:

- returns error codes and messages from MUSICA functions using new error handling in MICM
- creates a musica_ccpp module to act as a the CCPP interface and moves existing functionality to a musica_ccpp_micm module in preparation for adding TUV-x (we will use musica_ccpp_ as a prefix for all the MUSICA modules in this repo to prevent naming conflicts with MUSICA Fortran library modules)
- updates build scripts for changes to MUSICA and CCPP framework

One-line Summary: dadadj CCPP mods
Github PR URL: https://github.com/ESCOMP/atmospheric_physics/pull/91

This PR fixes the following NCAR/atmospheric_physics Github issues:
    - Creates the CCPP interface for the dadadj routine
    - dadadj.F90 routine was slightly refactored to update the logic and syntax

Additionally it was discovered that the temporary variable for cappa interface was
	not set properly each time through the loop that makes the dry adiabatic adjustment.
	This bug was fixed as part of this PR with the following line.

	cappaint = 0.5_kind_phys*(cappa(i,k+1) + cappa(i,k))

List and Describe any test failures:
    - Tested in CAM
	Because dadadj doesn't normally get tripped I modified the Temp
	profile to create an instability where the code would be exercised.
	The snapshot files contain this instability.  The modification adds
	60 degrees to the layer 2 temperature.

1) Updated Kessler/ZM/geopotential meta data files to use updated gravity standard name
2) Added test suite definition files to test the before/after coupler
functions in isolation
3) Updated the design of the `run` functions to pass in state data and output
tendencies (instead of modifying state directly) and the tendencies are now
applied afterwards via additional `apply_*` schemes listed in the suite
definition file.
4) Updates several variables from CAM that were 2D to now be 3D to enable
future updates to take the vertical dimension into account for different
planetary physics.
5) Adds `index_top_interface` in `*_sfc_pbl_hs` scheme to allow integrating
with models that invert the vertical dimension data.
6) Introduces minor answer change to `*_sfc_pbl_hs` functionality documented
below.

List and Describe any test failures:

- There is a single know change to the after coupler run function
(tj2016_sfc_pbl_hs) which has consistently been off on timestep 2 only
by at most 0.13E-22 for a single variable (excerpt from run/atm log):

One-line Summary: Unit updates for consistency with SIMA
Github PR URL: https://github.com/ESCOMP/atmospheric_physics/pull/81

Purpose of changes (include the issue number and title text for each relevant GitHub issue):
 - Update the following units which were incorrect and/or couldn't be
   auto-converted (standard_name: old -> new)
   - mpi_communicator: 1 -> index
   - mpi_root: 1 -> index
   - ccpp_constituents: kg kg-1 -> none
   - vertical_index_at_top_interface: count -> index
   - vertical_index_at_surface_interface: count -> index
   - vertical_index_at_top_adjacent_layer: count -> index
   - vertical_index_at_surface_adjacent_layer: count -> index
   - dry_static_energy: J m-2 -> J kg-1
   - surface_reference_pressure: mb -> Pa
 - Bring in the following approved standard names changes (old -> new):
   - reference_pressure -> surface_reference_pressure
   - reference_pressure_in_atmosphere_layer_normalized_by_reference_pressure ->
    reference_pressure_in_atmosphere_layer_normalized_by_surface_reference_pressure
   - heating_rate -> tendency_of_dry_air_enthalpy_at_constant_pressure
   - density_of_dry_air -> dry_air_density
   - print_qneg_warn -> control_for_negative_constituent_warning
 - update group names for existing schemes (physics_before_coupler and
 physics_after_coupler)

One-line Summary: Update standard and function names plus major code clean-up
Github PR URL: https://github.com/NCAR/atmospheric_physics/pull/67

Purpose of changes (include the issue number and title text for each relevant GitHub issue):

The main purpose of this PR is to update the CCPP standard names to match the
internal AMP agreed-upon names, as well as rename some of the physics routines
to make them less ambigious and more accurate.  Along with these changes,
significant code cleanup was performed along with some minor bug fixes,
with the goal being to produce bit-for-bit results using the same repo
version in both CAM and CAM-SIMA.

This PR fixes the following NCAR/atmospheric_physics Github issues:

#60 -> Required atmospheric physics updates
#61 -> "calc_exner_run" routine should be given reference pressure argument
#62 -> Need to update geopotential_t to use "generalized" virtual temperature
#64 -> held_suarez_1994 SDF needs the geopotential_t scheme.
