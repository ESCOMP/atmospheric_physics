One-line Summary: Update standard and function names plus major code clean-up
Github PR URL: https://github.com/NCAR/atmospheric_physics/pull/67

Purpose of changes (include the issue number and title text for each relevant GitHub issue):

The main purpose of this PR is to update the CCPP standard names to match the
internal AMP agreed-upon names, as well as rename some of the physics routines
to make them less ambigious and more accurate.  Along with these changes,
significant code cleanup was performed along with some minor bug fixes,
with the goal being to produce bit-for-bit results using the same repo
version in both CAM and CAM-SIMA.

This PR fixes the following NCAR/atmospheric_physics Github issues:

#60 -> Required atmospheric physics updates
#61 -> "calc_exner_run" routine should be given reference pressure argument
#62 -> Need to update geopotential_t to use "generalized" virtual temperature
#64 -> held_suarez_1994 SDF needs the geopotential_t scheme.
