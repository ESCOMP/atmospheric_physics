      Hack shallow convection.
      There are several nuances to the convect_shallow calling routine.
      convect_shallow takes in total (from deep) convective cmfmc, qc, rliq and adds shallow convective tendencies
      from Hack to them, also computing freqsh.
      rliq is "reserved" liquid to be later added in macrophysics.

      Tendencies are applied, then zm_conv_evap is ran to evaporate some of the precip directly into the environment to apply another set of tendencies.

      This zm_conv_evap call takes as input some of the shallow convective quantities and adds to them, including
      - precc -> prec (lwe_precipitation_rate_at_surface_due_to_..._convection)

      Thus, an interstitial scheme to simply "convert" the shallow tendencies to the general tendencies in preparation for the zm_conv_evap call is also needed.
